# My interest

- UFC: This project should be a catalog for all the UFC events till date with the possibility of adding more (scheduled to take place)
- For each UFC event:
- Extract the poster for it (a URL) and have it be displayed.
- Create a link to each of these posters (clicking on it should take you to a page which displays the details of that event)
- Details of a UFC event should include:
  - All Fights
  - Weight Division the fighters are in
  - Fighter details (link it to the UFC stats page)
